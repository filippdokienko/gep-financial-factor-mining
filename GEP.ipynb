    "- *Chromosome*: Linear string of symbols (genes) representing *functions* and *terminals* (e.g. a Single-Gene Chromosome: *+ a b \\* c d*, where *+* is the root, *a* and *\\** are children of *+*, while *b* and *c* are children of *\\**)\n",
    "<br> *Genes* are fixed-length strings, divided into two parts: *Heads* consists of *functions* and *terminals*, whereas *tails* contains only *terminals*. Essentially, the *head* generates any kind of *expression tree*, and the *tail* ensures that they have enough arguments to form a valid tree.  The number of genes is decided.\n",
    "<br> The length of the *head* $h$ is chosen, and the length of the *tail* $t$ depends on it. $t = h(n-1)+1$, where $n$ is the maximum number of arguments for the function with most arguments (e.g. $n = 2$ for *+*).\n",
    "<br> By default the linking function of different genes within a chromosome is chosen in advance, but the linking operation could also be introduced in the chromosome. \n",
    "- *Functions*: Operators s.a. +, -, *, /, or custom functions\n",
    "- *Terminals*: Variables/Factors\n",
    "- *Expression Tree (ET)*: Decoded form of the chromosome, used for evaluation (tree-like structure (phenotype)). Does not need to have the same size as the Chromosome.\n",
    "- *Fitness Function*: Function to evaluate goodness of solution\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "1. Create Initial Population: Random chromosomes\n",
    "2. Decode Chromosomes to ETs\n",
    "3. Evaluate FÃ­tness of each individual\n",
    "4. Decide whether to continue or stop (Termination Condition)\n",
    "5. Select Surviving Individuals:\n",
    "    - Elitism, to ensure that the top X individuals are part of the next generation (skipping the genetic operations) (and replicate them to the next generation).\n",
    "    - Remaining population is subject to other selection procedures (e.g. roulette wheel) and genetic operations.\n",
    "6. Apply Genetic Operations\n",
    "    - Except for mutation, a chromosome can only be modified once per operator.\n",
    "    - Mutation: Randomly change part of chromosome (each position in the chromosome has a mutation rate)\n",
    "    <br> In the paper, they state that the typical *mutation rate* $p_m$ is two point mutations per chromosome $p_m = 2/positions\\_in\\_chromosome$. Every position has a $p_m$ chance to be mutated.\n",
    "    - Transpositions: \n",
    "        - IS Transposition: Copy and insert randomly selected segment of chromosome into the head of the same gene, at a random position other than the very start. The head of the gene is trimmed to maintain the fixed size.\n",
    "    <br> Typically, an IS transposition rate $p_{is}$ of 0.1 is used and a set of 3 different lengths (e.g. [1,2,3]) are used. The start position of the IS element, its length and insertion point are selected randomly.\n",
    "        - RIS Transposition: Copy and insert randomly selected segment of chromosome starting with a function to the root (start) of the head.\n",
    "    <br> Typically the RIS transposition rate $p_{ris}$ is 0.1 and there is a set of 3 different possible IS element lengths. A point is randomly chosen in the head, and the gene is scanned downstream until a function is found. The last symbols of the head are lost (as many as the IS length)\n",
    "        - Gene Transposition: Randomly selected gene (other than first) is moved (not copied!) to the beginning of the chromosome. Depending on the linking function, this may not have any impact on the chromosomes fitness, but it has an affect in crossover, allowing the duplication of genes. Typically, $p_g$ is 0.1.\n",
    "    - Recombination: Every pair (after selection mechanism) has a chance to produce 2 off-springs, or otherwise proceed to the next generation. The overall recombination rate proposed in the paper is 0.7.\n",
    "        - One-point Recombination: Chooses random position as crossover point, and exchange material at this point forming two offsprings. The probability $p_{1r}$ for this is usually the highest.\n",
    "        - Two-point Recombination: Chooses 2 random positions as crossover points and exchanges material at this point. Probability is $p_{2r}$.\n",
    "        - Gene Recombination: Chooses a random gene position and exchanges this one among the parents. Probability $p_{gr}$ is usually lower than the other two; frequently set to 0.1.\n",
    "7. Repeat through generations from step 4 onwards"
